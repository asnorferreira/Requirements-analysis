# Voice-Controlled Access System

## Project Overview
This project implements a voice-controlled access system integrated with lighting, air conditioning, and security features like camera-based presence identification and facial recognition.

## Technologies Used
- Python for backend development.
- Voice recognition APIs for voice command processing.
- Facial recognition software for security enhancements.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the system settings as per your environment.

## Usage
- Run `main.py` to start the system.
